To make Prisma migrations work with Supabase and pgBouncer, you need two database URLs:

1. For runtime (already in your .env):
DATABASE_URL with ?pgbouncer=true (which you already have)

2. For migrations (needs to be added to .env):
Same as DATABASE_URL but WITHOUT ?pgbouncer=true and other connection parameters

Add this to your .env:
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.dlzfhnnwyvddaoikrung:DNE8ytm_uyw1jbc*qbr@aws-0-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"
